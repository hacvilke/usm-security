# 🛡️ Universal Security Module (USM)

**Universal Security Module v2026.2** is a hardened, server-authoritative security framework designed for Roblox developers who care about performance, fairness, and long-term exploit resistance.

This repository contains the **official project website** and documentation for USM.

---

## 🚀 Overview

USM focuses on **behavioral and physics validation** rather than trusting client-side values.  
It is built to detect **impossible movement patterns**, **physics abuse**, and **unauthorized client manipulation** — all while remaining lag-safe and scalable.

Designed for:
- Competitive PvP games
- Parkour / obby games
- Open-world and progression games
- Professional Roblox developers

---

## 🔐 Core Principles

- **Server-side authority only**
- **Physics consistency over time**
- **No client spyware**
- **No invasive data collection**
- **Roblox API compliant**

USM does not rely on simple WalkSpeed or Humanoid state checks that exploiters easily bypass.
